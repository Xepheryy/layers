# Layers - Docker Layer Management Tool

Layers is an open-source tool designed to help developers visualize, manage, and optimize Docker image layers. The project aims to provide an intuitive interface for understanding the composition of Docker images, identifying large or redundant layers, and optimizing container builds.

> **New to containers or experienced developer troubleshooting deployment issues?** Layers provides the visibility you need to understand your Docker images and resolve those mysterious container problems that keep your deployments from succeeding.
